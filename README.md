# IPKCPC Client Application

## Introduction
This application is a client for the IPKCPC protocol. It allows communication with a server using either TCP or UDP.

## Usage
To start the IPKCPC client application, open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the application is downloaded. Then, run the following command:

```ipkcpc -h <host> -p <port> -m <mode>```

Replace `<host>` with the IPv4 address of the server, `<port>` with the server port, and `<mode>` with either `tcp` or `udp`.

## Important Notes
The IPKCPC client application is a command-line interface (CLI) tool and does not have a graphical user interface (GUI).
Make sure to use the correct IPv4 address and port number for the server when starting the client.
The client only supports communication with a server that implements the IPKCPC protocol.
